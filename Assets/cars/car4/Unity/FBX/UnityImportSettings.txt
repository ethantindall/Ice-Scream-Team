To import the car into Unity, simply drag the FBX file into your Unity project folder.

Next, drag the texture files into the same folder as the car FBX. Unity will automatically link them if the names match.

Click on the car FBX asset to open its settings in the Inspector tab on the right side of the screen.

In the Model section, check the box labeled "Bake Axis Conversion" and click Apply. This ensures the car faces the correct direction.

If the pivot points appear centered instead of at the door hinges or wheels, go to the Scene view. In the top-left corner, change the dropdown from "Center" to "Pivot" to view and rotate objects from their actual pivot points.
